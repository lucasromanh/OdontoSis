**Project ID:** 6212794962705069784

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
Professional, clean, and clinical. The atmosphere is medical and modern ("Med-Tech"), using high-contrast typography for legibility and subtle shadows for depth.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Primary Brand Blue (#137fec):** Used for primary actions, active navigation states, and branding.
- **Slate Gray (#64748b):** Used for secondary text and icons.
- **Pure White (#ffffff):** Used for card backgrounds and navigation surfaces.
- **Success Green (#10b981):** Used for positive trends and active appointment statuses.

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Font Family:** Inter (primary)
- **Headers:** Bold (font-weight 700), high emphasis.
- **Body:** Regular (font-weight 400), slate gray for readability.

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Generously rounded corners (`rounded-xl`), primary blue background with white text for CTAs.
* **Cards:** Soft drop shadows (`shadow-sm`), white background, and `rounded-2xl` corners.
* **Navigation:** Sidebar navigation with icons and subtle hover states.

## 5. Layout Principles
- **Grid:** Responsive grid alignment.
- **Spacing:** Ample whitespace to maintain a clean "clinical" feel.
